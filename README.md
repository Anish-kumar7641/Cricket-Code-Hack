# Cricket Prediction App

This React project is designed to predict the performance of batsmen and bowlers in upcoming cricket matches. The application utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast the number of runs a batsman will score and the number of fours they are likely to hit. Additionally, it predicts the number of balls a bowler will deliver in the upcoming matches.

## Features

- **Batsman Run Prediction:** Using historical data and machine learning models, the app forecasts the expected number of runs a particular batsman might score in an upcoming match.
- **Fours Prediction:** Predicts the number of boundary shots (fours) a batsman is likely to hit during the match.
- **Bowler's Ball Prediction:** Utilizes statistical analysis and predictive modeling to estimate the number of balls a bowler might bowl in the forthcoming game.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The frontend of the application is built using React.js, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Machine Learning:** Python libraries such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow are used for predictive modeling and analysis of historical cricket data.
- **API Integration:** Possible integration with cricket APIs to fetch real-time match data, player statistics and weather data.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm start`.

## Usage

1. Upon starting the app, the user can input/select the batsman's name  for whom they want to predict runs and fours.
2. Similarly, the user can input/select the bowler's name to predict the number of balls they might bowl.
3. The app will display the predictions based on the machine learning models and historical data analysis.


## Acknowledgements

- This project was inspired by the love for cricket and the curiosity to predict player performances.
